# Week 05 Kickoff

**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Status:** Kickoff; Phase 0 complete.

## Objective

Prepare Week 05 so the next AI-assisted implementation pass starts from the real project state and a narrow MVP scope.

Week 04 is complete. The system has been validated end-to-end with listening indicators, conversation calibration, and demo resilience. Week 05 focuses on making the existing system demo-ready: clear startup, polished conversational UX, graceful error handling, and a successful multi-run rehearsal.

## Current State at Kickoff

Week 04 is complete (Phases 0-5).

Validated paths:
- Raspberry voice loop: `client/main.py --mode voice` with listening indicator.
- Web voice loop: browser microphone with visible indicator and auto-stop.
- Text fallback: `POST /chat`.
- Backend: `POST /chat/audio` with STT via OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`.
- In-memory session history.
- Prompt calibrated for Spanish, child-friendly, short answers.

Current test state:
- 52 Python tests pass.
- Web typecheck: to be verified.

Known gaps:
- Demo startup requires multiple manual commands.
- No single runbook for demo operators.
- Error messages are technical.
- ALSA/JACK warnings clutter terminal.
- No structured demo rehearsal evidence.

## Prepared Documents

- `specs/week-05-demo-stability.md`
- `docs/plans/week-05-demo-stability.md`
- `docs/project-journal/week-05.md`

## Proposed Week 05 Phases

0. Documentation kickoff and handoff for agents.
1. Demo runbook and startup scripts.
2. Conversational UX polish.
3. Error resilience.
4. Demo rehearsal (3+ consecutive runs).
5. Closeout with evidence.

## Recommended Next Action

Phase 1: create a demo runbook and startup script to reduce operator friction.

## AI Tools Used

(none yet â€” kickoff phase)

## Human Decisions

(none yet)

## Notes

- Week 05 applies the MVP rule: no new features unless they directly unblock the demo.
- ALSA/JACK warnings are a known non-blocking issue from Week 03-04; they should be documented or suppressed, not "fixed" with architecture changes.


## Phase 1 — Demo Runbook and Startup Scripts (implemented 2026-06-08)

**Branch:** `feature/week-05-phase1-demo-runbook`
**Tracking:** GitHub issue #35

### Objective

Reduce the friction of starting a TONTO demo so an operator can start with 1-2 commands.

### Changes

**`scripts/demo-raspberry.sh`** (new):
- Bash script for Raspberry Pi demo startup.
- Default env vars: `TONTO_BACKEND_URL`, `TONTO_AUDIO_DEVICE`, `TONTO_RECORD_SECONDS`.
- Health check with 5 retries and 2s delay before starting.
- Activates venv and starts client in voice mode.

**`docs/demo-runbook.md`** (new):
- Prerequisites section.
- Quick start: 3 commands (backend, Raspberry, web).
- Full demo flow for Raspberry (5 steps).
- Full demo flow for web (5 steps).
- Known warnings (ALSA/JACK) documented as ignorable.
- Troubleshooting: 6 common failures with fixes.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Demo operator can start with 1-2 commands.
- [x] Health check with reintentos funciona.
- [x] Runbook cubre flujo completo de demo Raspberry.
- [x] Runbook cubre flujo completo de demo web.
- [x] Warnings ALSA/JACK documentados como ignorables.
- [x] Troubleshooting cubre fallos comunes de ambos clientes.

### Status

- [ ] Raspberry hardware validation pending.
- [ ] Issue #35 ready to close.
